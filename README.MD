# Bitsology

The Bitsology project is a Python-based initiative that generates unique passwords based on images. Users can select an image and the program will generate a unique password based on the image's bytecode. A TXT file is then created containing this password, which is stored in the same directory. As passwords are not randomized, the same password will be generated if the image remains constant. The output of programs is not pure bytecode, but rather the interpretation of these values as a strong password.
